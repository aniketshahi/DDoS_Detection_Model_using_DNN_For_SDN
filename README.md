# DDoS Detection System Model for SDN Networks Using DNN

## Overview
This project implements a system model for detecting Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). SDN networks, due to their centralized control, are particularly vulnerable to DDoS attacks. This model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance network security and ensure stability.

## Features
- Real-time detection of DDoS attacks in SDN environments.
- Preprocessing and feature extraction tailored for SDN network traffic.
- Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for high accuracy in malicious traffic detection.
- Integration with SDN controllers for automated threat mitigation.
- Visualization and reporting tools for detailed traffic analysis.

## System Architecture
1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - Captures SDN network traffic data (e.g., flow-based features from OpenFlow switches).
   - Compatible with common SDN controllers like OpenDaylight and Ryu.

2. **Preprocessing Layer**:
   - Cleans and formats raw network traffic data.
   - Extracts flow features such as packet rate, flow duration, and byte count.

3. **Feature Extraction and Selection**:
   - Identifies relevant features for DDoS detection.
   - Reduces data dimensionality while retaining critical traffic indicators.

4. **Deep Neural Network (DNN) Model**:
   - **Input Layer**: Represents selected features from network traffic data.
   - **Hidden Layers**: Multiple fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
   - **Output Layer**: Binary classification (normal vs. malicious traffic) or multi-class (specific attack types).
   - **Training**: Uses labeled datasets containing normal and DDoS traffic. Optimized with Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

5. **Detection Layer**:
   - Classifies incoming traffic in real-time.
   - Alerts administrators of potential DDoS threats.
   - Integrates with SDN controllers to apply mitigation rules (e.g., flow blocking or rate limiting).

6. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Provides dashboards for network traffic analysis.
   - Generates detailed reports on detection statistics and mitigation actions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing code and results.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `scikit-learn` and `tensorflow/keras` for machine learning and deep learning.
